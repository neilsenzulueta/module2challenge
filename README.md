Professional Portfolio

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to create a web application from scratch using HTML and CSS.
I wanted to create a professional portfolio that can showcase my skills and work projects to future employers.
The web application presents my completed projects making it accessible to future employers.

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage can be used to view my initial professional Portfolio as a beginner web page developer.  There are three navigation bars (about me, work,contact me). Click on each link in the navigation and should respond to the corresponding section. Main functionality of this webapage was focused on flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
